- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language for exploring databases.
- Using SQL we can perform various operations on data in out database tables.
- We can, for instance, DELETE, CREATE, SELECT and UPDATE tables, records and fields.

* SQLite

- There's no better way of learning SQL commands than actually using it.
- Python has an inbuilt module called =sqlite= that we can use to create and manipulate a database.
** Code It

- Create a new directory called CN_Database.
- Inside the directory, create a new Python3 file called CN_Database.py
- We'll need some fairly standard code to start off with.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('ChuckNorris.db')
c = conn.cursor()
#+END_SRC
- Here we have created an empty database object and a cursor object.
- The cursor object has a method called =execute()= that we will call everytime we want to use SQL statements.
- Let's start by creating a table
#+BEGIN_SRC python
c.execute('''CREATE TABLE filmography
    
#+END_SRC

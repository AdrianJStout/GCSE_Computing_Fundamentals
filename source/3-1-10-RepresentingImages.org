- When an image is displayed on a computer monitor, pixels (which are the smallest addressable point on a display) are illuminated in different colours.
[[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Pixel-example.png]]  
- In a standard bitmap image file (.bmp), each of these pixels is represented by three 8 bit binary numbers.
- The first binary number represents the amount of red, the second the amount of green and the third the amount of blue.
- So this colour =here= is:
  - 1101 0101 Red (213)
  - 1111 1111 Green (255)
  - 1100 0000 Blue (192)
- Strings of binary numbers are difficult to read however, so we use hex instead.

- Convert each of the binary integers above into hexadecimal notation.

- Bitmap images are made up of two parts.
- The first part is the header. This contains information such as the size of the image and the type of file.
- The second part is the image data itself.
** Try It

:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- Open up Sublime Text (or another hex editor) and create a new file called myPic.hex
- We're going to code a bitmap image by hand.
